responses: During fights, the presses counter's modulo will determine the next button
idea: Generalize and exclude possibilities for the correct next level
responses: Set and check the phase's timer
add metronome sound
persistent memory
Level selector
difficulty: Make sliders for presses per minute/mistake that could be raised to lower the maximal press count
sound: Find 3 metronome like sounds then make them play in the bpm of the player then add instruments
root 43: Move hp_lose_interval_id to Fight
draw HP bar
animate character transition
initialization 52: construct fight from current level
view: Layout for each mod include a pane for a string array
mange the runtime in js or replace js_init with pairs of functions for initialization and usage
level 7: rethink the "unwrap"
app: make damage taken time independent
Update the damage on Frame instead of Dmg
Use program's duration directly with wrapped performance.now (main.mjs)
Make phases start at index 0

far future:
rebuild with "The entry point"
check command line testing server
slowness permission: Defining phases in which it is less punishing to make mistakes or be slow
Image: With arrays, transparent pixels for non square images, make the pixels push each other, shot pixels from multiple directions, 
deconstruct the image to rebuild it in reverse, support different image sizes
bugs: resize caused blur, frame drops
game mod: Memory challenge, remember the hidden buttons
Visuals that express the correct io

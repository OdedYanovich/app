difficulty: Make sliders for presses per minute/mistake that could be raised to lower the maximal press count

35: replace direct attribute with abstraction from css.gleam
30: behavior belongs to audio.gleam
89: the grid that hub makes and the main grid are using grid_template even if he makes a single row (unnecessary)
 the main grid may be better as a flexbox
 the color of the hp is from an element that will be defined in an element from css.gleam
 maybe grid_auto_flow can be removed
maybe remove the "modeBody"
rename the main canvas's id and mabye an id is unnecessary or at least the name may be given from a const

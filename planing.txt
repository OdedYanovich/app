idea: Generalize and exclude possibilities for the correct next level
persistent memory
difficulty: Make sliders for presses per minute/mistake that could be raised to lower the maximal press count
sound: Find 3 metronome like sounds then make them play in the bpm of the player then add instruments
animate characters sliding out of the screen
initialization 52: construct fight from current level
mange the runtime in js or replace js_init with pairs of functions for initialization and usage
app: make damage taken time independent
Update the damage on Frame instead of Dmg
goal: make 15 levels with a CountUp level for each 5 of them + Level selector
goal: color and background picker
goal: write a relation between the the player's speed and the music's speed and the hp display
goal: add metronome sound
css 22: in length_to_string, avoid repetition with list.fold
view 35: try to uncomment
discord: Explain how compile time evaluation and parameters could help with the ranged variables
init: extend the ranged variable to hold values beyond the range and use it on the volume


far future:
rebuild with "The entry point"
responses: Set and check the phase's timer
check command line testing server
slowness permission: Defining phases in which it is less punishing to make mistakes or be slow
Image: With arrays, transparent pixels for non square images, make the pixels push each other, shot pixels from multiple directions, 
deconstruct the image to rebuild it in reverse, support different image sizes
bugs: resize caused blur, frame drops
game mod: Memory challenge, remember the hidden buttons
Visuals that express the correct io

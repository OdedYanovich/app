idea: Generalize and exclude possibilities for the correct next level
persistent memory
difficulty: Make sliders for presses per minute/mistake that could be raised to lower the maximal press count
animate characters sliding out of the screen
initialization 52: construct fight from current level

goal: make 15 levels with a CountUp level for each 5 of them + Level selector
goal: color and background picker
goal: write a relation between the the player's speed and the music's speed and the hp display
goal: sell the player customization option for progress

css 22: in length_to_string, avoid repetition with list.fold
audio: wrap shared behavior
web audio api: learn it and write your vision
Make different function to make elements and display them in the game
music: increase the tempo and add instruments as the fight escalate

view: make the main div a grid (or FlaxBox) the holds 2 grids.
A list of element to be displayed in the lesser grid will match the mod,
the length of the list will match the row count of said grid.
The main grid's row and columns will match the mod.

view: make a record for the tuple that is represent the unique elements of the mods
view 35: replace direct attribute with abstraction from css.gleam
view 30: behavior belongs to audio.gleam
view 89: the grid that hub makes and the main grid are using grid_template even if he makes a single row (unnecessary)
view: the main grid may be better as a flexbox
view: the color of the hp is from an element that will be defined in an element from css.gleam
view: maybe grid_auto_flow can be removed
maybe remove the "modeBody"
rename the main canvas's id and mabye an id is unnecessary or at least the name may be given from a const

far future:
rebuild with "The entry point"
responses: Set and check the phase's timer
check command line testing server
slowness permission: Defining phases in which it is less punishing to make mistakes or be slow
Image: With arrays, transparent pixels for non square images, make the pixels push each other, shot pixels from multiple directions, 
deconstruct the image to rebuild it in reverse, support different image sizes
bugs: resize caused blur, frame drops
game mod: Memory challenge, remember the hidden buttons
Visuals that express the correct io
